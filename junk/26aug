Some other ISAs - MIPS, 8080, ARM, CISC, etc
David Patterson - Textbook, also won the turing award

Q: what compares to x86vector dialect or the arm_neon dialect in riscv ? does an extension to the ISA exist that helps me perform convolution for DL and CV applications?

The GNU Debugger
use crash dumps to backtrace what went wrong and where

Why is the fixed but 0? most common bit
Why not 1? it takes more power to store a 1 than to store a 0??

If we switch user as root (or boot into safe mode) does the processor mode change? YES

The supervisor mode is capable of going upto ring 2 or ring 1, and safely comes back to ring 3 when the processor switches into the user mode.

LSB is fixed to 0 because the mim inst size is 16 bits
